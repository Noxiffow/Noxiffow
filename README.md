# Hi, how is it going?

>  Let me introduce myself properly here, ok?

Since you already know my name, yes you, the *reader*. I'm going to skip that part.
At this moment, I am currently learning how to code, I've had my classes with Java and it didn't go well, so I'm trying to study on my own in hopes of going again with a solid base on Java.

>  Introducing my current goals

I did some weird order to learn things, I came into Git/Github out of curiosity and ended up loving it, and now I will learn how to mod, but I want to have a base so:
1. JAVA
2. C# (On going)
3. PYTHON

As of now I have that in list to learn, its truly a shame that I started off with Git because I know I will forget many things upon stop using it, but it is what it is. I'll have to recall the commands once I'm done.... I need **something** to work on so I can use Github at the end of the day.
